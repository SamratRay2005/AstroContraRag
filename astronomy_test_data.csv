Escape velocity is the speed needed to break free from a body's gravity without further propulsion.,A spacecraft must reach escape velocity to leave a planet's gravitational influence without more thrust.,Escape velocity is irrelevant; any speed will let you escape gravity without additional forces.
Tidal locking occurs when a body's rotation period matches its orbital period around its primary.,"When a moon is tidally locked, the same face always points toward its planet due to synchronized rotation and orbit.",Tidal locking causes a moon to rotate rapidly so all its faces see the planet equally.
